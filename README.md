# Requirements and Specification Document

## Melody Mapper

### Project Abstract

Melody Mapper is an application designed to convert voiced melodies into MIDI format. Users can input melodies through voice, and the application will transform them into MIDI representation, allowing for storage and playback. This functionality enables users to easily capture and manipulate melodies for various purposes, such as music composition, analysis, or playback. 

This project was worked on at The University of Wisconsin-Madison in Spring of 2024 as a class project for Computer Sciences 506: Software Engineering. The original authors of this project are: Darren Seubert, Ben Goh, Victor Nguyen, Livia Chandra, Roshni Venkat, and Don Ma. This repository is an extension of that project with the goal of improving conversion accuracy and cleaning up some features within the project.

### Customer

The target customer for this software spans musicians, composers, music producers, and enthusiasts who engage in the creation and manipulation of melodies. Specifically, individuals who seek efficient methods to transcribe melodies from voice to MIDI format for further exploration, modification, or integration into their creative projects would find this application valuable. Moreover, educators and students in music-related fields could benefit from its functionality for educational purposes, facilitating learning and experimentation with musical concepts.

### Use Cases & User Stories

1. As the user of the websites, in order to record the recording, the user will be able to record, playback and download the audio they recorded.
   - Once the user is satisfied with the recording, the user will be prompted to name the recording, author the audio recording, and credit other users.
   - Once the user submits the recording for conversion, the resulting MIDI file will be returned and displayed as a music sheet.
2. As the user of the website, the user will be able to see a list of converted recordings.
   - The list contains all the converted recordings that all the users have created in the database.
3. As the user of the website, the user can see a history of the converted recordings they have done.
4. As the user of the website, the user will be able to download the converted audio recording in a MIDI file format.
5. As the user of the website, the user will be able to search the uploaded and converted files.

### User Interface Requirements

The website applicatoins will have the following screens:

1. A security statement will be presented to the user before they can continue to the website
2. A main screen will show a record button, a file upload button, and conversion history where a user can download the midi file or xml sheet music for pervious uploaded recordings
3. Once the Start Recording button is pressed, the user will see an active recording screen
4. The user will be prompted to review their recording, and submit it for conversion
5. The user will be prompted to input details about the recording
6. The user will then be prompted if the upload and conversion had an error or if it was successful

![Conversion Sucecess](resources/Conversion_Success_Final.png)

### Security Requirements

- Our system will only record audio in between when the user has clicked the start and stop recording button.
- Our system will only store the MIDI file converted from audio recordings.
  - The system will state that the audio recordings will only be used for converting into the MIDI file.
  - MIDI files will be stored in the database and open for all users to see.
  - The system will not save audio recordings because users may want to avoid having their voice being recorded and stored on the system.
- Our system will be vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks.

### Standards & Conventions

This portion of the document outlines the coding standards and conventions that are used in this project.

#### Coding Standards

The team prioritized the following coding standards during development:

1. **Simplicity:** Keep code simple which makes the code easier to understand, debug, and maintain.
2. **Modularity:** Encourages breaking down code into small, cohesive modules or functions that perform specific tasks.
3. **Scalability:** Write code that can scale to accommodate future growth in terms of efficiency and complexity.
4. **Consistency:** Enforce consistent naming conventions, formatting styles, and coding practices across the codebase.
5. **Documentation:** Include meaningful comments and documentation to explain complex logic, algorithms, or non-obvious behavior. Document public APIs, parameters, return values, and important implementation details.
6. **Version Control:** Utilize version control systems effectively to track changes, collaborate with team members, and manage codebase evolution. Follow branching and merging best practices to facilitate parallel development and code review processes.

#### Formatting Conventions

For Front End software development we use the VSCode extension [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) in its default configuration.
Back End development uses the VSCode extension [Black Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter) in its default configuration.
These extensions provide out of the box solutions that are lightweight and easy to use.

You can also read more about the Python PEP 8 standard [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

#### Naming Conventions

1. **Compound Names:** Compound names should use upper case letters to mark the beginning of the next word "likeThis" and "LikeThisToo"
2. **User-defined Types:** Names of user-defined types (files, classes, or enumerated types) should begin with upper case letters "LikeThis" or "This"
3. **Functions:** Names of functions, including class methods, should begin with lower case letters "likeThis()" or "this()"
4. **Variables:** Names of variables should begin with a lower case letter "likeThis" or "this"
5. **Boolean Variables:** Boolean variables should be named as questions or states to reflect their meaning. For example: "isReady", "hasPermission"
   Constants: Names of constants should be written in uppercase letters with underscores separating words. For example: "MAX_SIZE", "PI_VALUE".
6. **Self-documenting Types and Functions:** Names of types and functions should be chosen to be self-documenting
7. **Meaningful Variables:** Names of meaningful variables should be chosen to be self-documenting. Names of variables whose function is internally important only, such as loop counters, should be simple.

#### Comment Conventions

1. **JavaScript:** For JavaScript functions, use JSDoc-style comments to provide documentation for functions. This includes a description of what the function does, parameters it accepts, and the return value.

```
/**
 * Calculate the sum of two numbers.
 *
 * @param {number} num1 - The first number.
 * @param {number} num2 - The second number.
 * @returns {number} The sum of num1 and num2.
 */
function sum(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}
```

2. **Python:** For Python functions, use docstrings to document the purpose, parameters, and return values of the function.

```
def calculate_sum(num1, num2):
    """
    Calculate the sum of two numbers.

    Args:
        num1 (int): The first number.
        num2 (int): The second number.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of num1 and num2.
    """
    return num1 + num2

```

3. **TODO Comments:** Use TODO comments to mark areas of code that need improvement or additional work. Include a brief description of what needs to be done and any relevant context.

#### File Headers Conventions

1. **JavaScript:**
